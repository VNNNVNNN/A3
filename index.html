			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<p>
				Question: Did males and females experience similar patterns of population growth or decline across different age groups?

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
				When discussing population and age, people often think of the classic pyramid-shaped analysis chart. I am no exception. However, despite the use of different colors to represent male and female genders on each side, such charts often appear overly symmetrical, making it difficult to discern differences. Therefore, building upon the traditional pyramid structure, I have additionally incorporated bar data representing the disparity between male and female populations, providing a clearer depiction of the demographic distribution.

				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
				Inspired by the organic pattern of tree rings, which not only denote age from the innermost rings outward but also offer a wealth of additional information, such as whether the year was rainy or dry, I am intrigued by the possibility of leveraging this organic element to convey more nuanced data. By employing varying hues and their intensities, we can potentially create a census ring that mirrors the tree ring like the reference image.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
				For the third chart, I aimed for a more minimalistic design. Drawing inspiration from projects like "Dear Data," I utilized a layout where each cube's position already conceals a wealth of information. Additionally, by incorporating different colors and textures, I sought to imbue the visualization with additional layers of meaning and depth, echoing the concept of finding complexity within simplicity.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Overall, I believe "tree ring" is the most creative and provocative, but considering accuracy and my beginner level with Tableau, I choose to develop the first one.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				Upon first encountering demographic data from the United States, I instinctively gravitate towards examining the disparities in population between genders. Some fundamental facts emerge readily; for instance, it's evident that women typically outlive men, no matter in 1900 or 2000. However, it's perplexing that male birth rates often surpass those of females. The conventional pyramid population chart, with genders depicted on either side, seems somewhat nonsensical in the context of the United States - it always look symmetrical. Yet, if an additional scale were included in the chart, representing the difference between the number of females and males, the pyramid would transform into a unsymmetrical figure. Regardless, subtracting one gender's count from the other inevitably skews the balance (resulting in bars on only one side). However, upon examining the generated images, it becomes apparent that excessively long bars are not uncommon. This discrepancy prompts the question: what are the underlying reasons for such imbalance?
      		</p>


      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        While I achieved my goal, integrating different scales into a single chart seemed rather risky. If I were more proficient with the software, I would like to experiment with the "tree ring" visualization technique introduced in the second chapter's sketch.
